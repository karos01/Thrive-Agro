üå± **Project Description**

THRIVE AGRO is a web app designed to improve farmers' conditions through dynamic features such as:

- **Inventory Management:** Farmers can track and manage their inventory by adding product quantity, expiration date, and product price. This helps them keep track of their stock levels for seeds, fertilizers, and monitoring equipment.
- **Buyer Contacts:** We connect farmers with mill owners who can directly purchase from them, eliminating the need for middlemen. This reduces transportation costs and the commission taken by intermediaries.
- **Reporting Section:** Farmers can report infrastructure problems such as poor roads, bad irrigation facilities, dam construction, etc., to the government. This open platform allows their issues to be addressed and resolved.
